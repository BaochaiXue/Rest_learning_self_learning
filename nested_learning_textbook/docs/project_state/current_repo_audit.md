## 2. Effective Assets (Valid as of Audit)

| Asset | Count | State |
|---|---|---|
| Papers with TeX source + `merged_paper.tex` | 22 | ✅ Good |
| Papers PDF-only (no public source) | 1 | ⚠️ Expected (Santoro ICML 2016) |
| Papers with mislabeled/corrupt download | 1 | ⚠️ Fixed (induction heads PDF renamed) |
| Papers entirely missing | 1 | ❌ `optimization_as_a_model_for_few_shot_learning` |
| v0 Markdown chapter drafts | 14 | ✅ Preserved as source material |
| Per-paper notes | 24 | ⚠️ All stubs (need content) |
| LaTeX chapters | 11 | ⚠️ Scaffolded (need content migration) |
| Bibliography entries | 24 | ✅ Generated in `library.bib` |

## 3. Structural Problems Identified

### 3a. Absolute Paths (FIXED)
- **`scripts/literature_engineer.py`**: contained `base_dir = "/Users/xinjiezhang/..."` — legacy artifact
- **`manifests/papers_manifest.csv`**: all `local_folder` and `note_path` fields were absolute — REBUILT with repo-relative paths

### 3b. Misnamed File (FIXED)
- `downloads/in_context_learning_and_induction_heads.tar.gz` was actually a PDF (arXiv returned PDF because this paper has no public TeX source). Renamed to `.pdf`.

### 3c. Missing Paper Folder
- `optimization_as_a_model_for_few_shot_learning` has no local folder (OpenReview paper, no arXiv TeX source). Status correctly marked `missing` in manifest. PDF download could be attempted.

### 3d. Legacy Root-Level Planning Docs
- `book_plan.md`, `chapter_map.md`, `consensus_vs_interpretation.md`, `learning_theory_scope.md`, `math_prerequisites.md`, `reading_list.md` are planning artifacts sitting loose at repo root.
- They have been **absorbed** into `docs/design-docs/` and `docs/references/`.
- Original files **preserved** as legacy stubs pointing to new canonical locations.

### 3e. `scripts/literature_engineer.py` — One-Shot Script (SUPERSEDED)
- Hardcoded absolute paths
- Not idempotent (would duplicate work on re-run)
- No logging or error recovery
- Superseded by `scripts/corpus_pipeline.py` (repo-relative, incremental, logged)
- Original script preserved for reference

### 3f. `notes/papers/` — All Stubs
- 24 note files exist but contain only generic placeholder text
- Need structured content per the note template in `docs/quality/qa_rubric.md`

### 3g. `manuscript/` — Source Material Only
- 14 Markdown files contain v0 pedagogical content
- Average ~3KB per file — brief but substantive outlines
- **Must NOT be treated as canonical book source**
- Must be used as content seed when expanding `book/chapters/`

## 4. Manifest Correctness After Rebuild

The manifest was rebuilt with corrected status codes:

| Status | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `source_and_merged` | 22 | Has TeX source + `merged_paper.tex` ✅ |
| `pdf_only` | 1 | Santoro 2016 — PDF in downloads, no TeX |
| `missing` | 1 | Optimization as a Model (OpenReview, no TeX) |

All paths are now **repo-relative** (relative to git repo root `Rest_learning/`).

## 5. Distance from Harness-Style Management (Pre-Migration)

| Dimension | Before | After (this pass) |
|---|---|---|
| Agent navigation map | ❌ None | ✅ AGENTS.md |
| System of record | ❌ Loose .md files | ✅ docs/ |
| LaTeX canonical manuscript | ❌ None | ✅ book/ scaffold |
| Repo-relative paths only | ❌ Absolute in manifest + scripts | ✅ Fixed |
| Incremental corpus pipeline | ❌ One-shot script | ✅ corpus_pipeline.py |
| Quality rubric | ❌ None | ✅ docs/quality/qa_rubric.md |
| Check scripts | ❌ None | ✅ 3 check scripts |
| Handoff artifact | ❌ None | ✅ docs/handoffs/latest_handoff.md |
| Exec plans | ❌ None | ✅ docs/exec-plans/ |

## 6. Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Phase 5**: Expand LaTeX chapter content — migrate v0 Markdown into proper TeX
2. **Phase 2b**: Write substantive per-paper notes (currently all stubs)
3. **Phase 5b**: Add worked examples and toy problem code in appendix
4. **Phase 6**: Run `make check`, fix remaining hygiene issues, validate bib
5. **Phase 7**: Expand into full publication-ready chapters
